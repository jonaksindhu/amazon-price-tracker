Web automation for tracking Amazon product prices and stock availability using Playwright.


Amazon Price Tracker ðŸš€

Hey! This is a simple project I started to track prices and stock on Amazon using Playwright.
Just made the first test case today and set up the folder structure.

Iâ€™ll be adding more stuff little by little, day by day â€” like price checking, reports, alerts, and who knows what else! ðŸ˜„

What it does now

Opens Amazon website
Searches for a product
Checks the first product title to make sure results show up
Has folders for tests, config, reports, scripts
Whatâ€™s coming soon

Get actual prices and check if product is in stock
Make nice reports you can open in browser
Send emails when price drops (would be cool right?)
Put project in Docker so its easy to run anywhere
Setup CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins or Github actions
How to try it

Clone the repo
Run npm install
Run tests with npx playwright test
Watch it open amazon and do the search for you
Why Iâ€™m doing this

Cause checking amazon all the time is annoying and slow â€” automation ftw!
Also wanna get better at Playwright and testing overall.

Wanna help?

Open issues, send feature ideas, or just star the repo if you like it!
Iâ€™m adding stuff everyday so stay tuned :)

Thanks for dropping by! ðŸ™Œ
